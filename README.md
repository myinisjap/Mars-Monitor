# Mars-Monitor
A monitoring web application for Ethernet enabled Mars printers
This might also work with the Photon and Epax but it has not been tested.

This is in a very alpha state use at your own risk.

This was built around python 3.7 it might work for other versions but there is no guarantee.

To use the application all you need to do is clone the repo and run 
"pip install -r requirements.txt" while in the base directory of the project.
After that just run app.py. I would recommend using a virtual environment but that is up to you.

The app will be served at "localhost:8000".
